# landing-page

This is actually an assignment for The Odin Project, which suggests students to create a sample landing page. In this assignment, we learn how to use the box model and flexbox in different scenarios. Flexbox is very hard to implement to be frank, but I guess my result isn't too bad, so I should be proud of myself :'D
